        <h2>Shaken, Not Stirred?</h2>
        <p>I got curious and wanted to know if there was an actual difference between shaking a martini and stirring it.</p>
        <p>I thought it wouldn't matter, since you're just mixing the ingredients, but apparently a study was conducted to determine if the preparation of a martini had any influence on its antioxident capacity.</p>
        <p>The study found that shaken gin martinis were able to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only 0.072% of the peroxide behind, while the stirred gin martini left behind 0.157% of the peroxide.</p>
        
        <p>Based on this information I have concluded that for James Bond to detect a difference this small, he must be massively autistic.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>45ml Tanqueray No. TEN Gin</li>
            <li>15ml Vodka</li>
            <li>10ml White Vermouth</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Lemon Zest, for Garnish</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Pour all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker, add cubed ice and shake for 10-15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Double strain by using the regular strainer in your cocktail shaker and holding a fine mesh strainer over your glass. Pour through both strainers into a martini glass.</li>
            <li>Release the oils from the lemon by pinching the skin and spraying over the glass. Place within the glass.</li>
         </ol>
