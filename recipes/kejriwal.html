        <h2>Theft by Finding</h2>
        <p>This recipe belongs to the good people at <a href="https://www.dishoom.com/birmingham/">Dishoom</a>, but in the spirit of the free exchange of ideas, I'm stealing it and giving it to you.</p>
        <p>Most of the best recipes are stolen anyway.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Add the bread to the plate and pour the beans over </li>
