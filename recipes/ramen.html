        <h2>A Brief Word About Magic</h2>
        <p>My partner Taylor, to reveal her a full government name, is quite possibly a wizard. I've had my suspicions for a while, borne of her love of cats, affection for the moon and vague witchyness that surrounds her, but it wasn't until I tried these noodles that I realised she really <em>could </em> do magic.</p>
        <p>So, from our cauldron to yours, here's <strong> T's Magic Ramen</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>Shin Ramyun Noodles - 1 Pack</li>
            <li>Roast Chicken Slices - 2 Pieces</li>
            <li>Egg - 1</li>
